# La Veille

The daily and collective technological watch in Becode.

It is important to keep up to date with the latest advances, programming languages, tools and tutorials... in short, to be always up to date and improve.  

## How does it work
Every day, one of us chooses an article or topic related to web development that has recently made headlines, ideally related to what we are working on at that time. For example, it may be a new techno, an unknown or recent CSS property, etc.

It usually consists of an informal presentation led by the student to other members of the class, possibly using the projector, followed by a feedback session. It takes place at a specific time of the day (in Central, it is 13h30 ). The speech itself should not last more than 15 minutes, and its preparation should not exceed a total of one hour. 

It is a moment of conviviality allowing everyone to practice public speaking, to share a discovery / reading / learning... which has interested us personally and which we want to share. Without worrying about it, but always keeping in mind to do the right thing. To live together a moment of "joyful knowledge": this light that illuminates us when we understand something.

## Your turn!
In order to be able to organize, each student must register by cloning this repo and modifying the file[agenda](./agenda.md) by following this procedure:

Via the terminal:  

1. Create a folder on your local disk called (for example) "/home/user/becode/veille"   
`mkdir /home/user/becode/veille`  
1. go in: `cd /home/user/user/becode/standby`
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/becodeorg/La-Veille.git`
1. Move to the'La-Veille' folder  
1. Update your local copy with the updates of the others: `git pull`.  
1. Create a new branch by giving it your first and last name, in order to minimize the risk of conflict: `git branch {first name}` (replaces the part between `{}`)
1. Go to your branch:  
 `git checkout {first name}`   
1. Tell Github that he has to create your branch also on github.com and not only locally: 
 `git push --set-upstream origin {first name}`  
1. Open the file[agenda.md](./agenda.md) and add the **date of passage**, **subject**, **your first name and surname** at the bottom of the list (which must remain chronological)  
1. Commit with a descriptive message, for example:  
   - `git add.` (to add modified files to the next commit stage)  
   - `git commit -m "Add my next watch on CSS gradients "`: the commit itself   
1. Apply your changes from your branch to the "master" branch:   
   - `git checkout master`  
   - `git merge {first name}`  
1. Update the repository on the Github server: `git push`.
